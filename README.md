# Customer-Segmentation

The Segmentation.ipynb is the main notebook where the segmentation was performed. This file created the Output.csv
Segment Classification.ipynb contains the code that trains the models to classify the customers into a segment and saves it to a model that can be used by the SegmentPredictor.py which opens a flask server that allows for api requests to the server which returns a prediction of what class a customer belongs to. 


Profiling.ipynb is the code that was used to plot the graphs and was used to infer the cluster characteristics. 

The Profiling_second and output_second.csv were used for the A-priori analysis of High value customer.
